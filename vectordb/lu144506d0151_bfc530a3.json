These devices are \npart of a family of current-sense amplifiers (also \ncalled current-shunt monitors) that sense voltage \ndrops across current-sense resistors at common-\nmode voltages from \u20130.2 V to +26 V, independent \nof the supply voltage. The INAx180 -Q1 integrate \na matched resistor gain network in four, fixed-gain \ndevice options:", " resistors at common-\nmode voltages from \u20130.2 V to +26 V, independent \nof the supply voltage. The INAx180 -Q1 integrate \na matched resistor gain network in four, fixed-gain \ndevice options: 20 V/V, 50 V/V, 100 V/V, or 200 V/V. \nThis matched gain resistor network minimizes gain \nerror and reduces the temperature drift.\nAll these devices operate from a single 2.7-V to 5.5-V \npower supply. The single-channel INA180 -Q1 draws \na maximum supply current of 260 \u00b5A; whereas, the \ndual-channel INA2180 -Q1 draws a maximum supply \ncurrent of 500 \u00b5A, and the quad channel draws a \nmaximum supply current of 900 \u00b5A.\nThe INA180 -Q1 is available in a 5-pin, SOT-23 \npackage with two different pin configurations. The \nINA2180 -Q1 is available in a 8-pin, VSSOP package . \nThe INA4180 -Q1 is available in a 14-pin, TSSOP \npackage. All device options are specified over the \nextended operating temperature range of \u201340\u00b0C to \n+125\u00b0C.\nPackaging Information(1) \nPART NUMBER PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nINA180 -Q1 SOT-23 (5) 2.90 mm \u00d7 1.60 mm\nINA2180-Q1 VSSOP (8) 3.00 mm \u00d7 3.00 mm\nINA4180 -Q1 TSSOP (14) 5.00 mm \u00d7 4.40 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the package option \naddendum at the end of the data sheet.INA180-Q1 , INA2180-Q1 , INA4180-Q1\nSLYS017D  \u2013 APRIL 2018 \u2013 REVISED JULY 2022\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

These specially-designed, current-\nsensing amplifiers accurately measures voltages developed across current-sensing resistors on common-mode \nvoltages that far exceed the supply voltage powering the device.

One \napplication that requires high bandwidth and slew rate is low-side motor control, where the ability to follow rapid \nchanging current in the motor allows for more accurate control over a wider operating range. Another application \nthat requires higher bandwidth and slew rates is system fault detection, where the INAx180 -Q1 are used with an \nexternal comparator and a reference to quickly detect when the sensed current is out of range.\n8.3.2 Wide Input Common-Mode Voltage Range\nThe INAx180 -Q1 support input common-mode voltages from \u20130.2 V to +26 V. Because of the internal topology, \nthe common-mode range is not restricted by the power-supply voltage (V S) as long as V S stays within the \noperational range of 2.7 V to 5.5 V. The ability to operate with common-mode voltages greater or less than V S \nallow the INAx180 -Q1 to be used in high-side, as well as low-side, current-sensing applications, as shown in \nFigure 8-4 .\nBus Supply\n\u00b10.2 V to +26 V\nHigh-Side Sensing\nLow-Side SensingLOADCommon-mode voltage (V CM) \nis bus-voltage dependent.\nCommon-mode voltage (V CM) \nis always near ground and is \nisolated from bus-voltage spikes.Direction of Positive \nCurrent Flow\nIN+Direction of Positive \nCurrent Flow\nRSENSERSENSE\nIN\u00b1IN+\nIN\u00b1\nFigure ", " (V CM) \nis always near ground and is \nisolated from bus-voltage spikes.Direction of Positive \nCurrent Flow\nIN+Direction of Positive \nCurrent Flow\nRSENSERSENSE\nIN\u00b1IN+\nIN\u00b1\nFigure 8-4. High-Side and Low-Side Sensing Connections\n8.3.3 Precise Low-Side Current Sensing\nWhen used in low-side current sensing applications the offset voltage of the INAx180 -Q1 is within \u00b1150 \u00b5V. The \nlow offset performance of the INAx180 -Q1 has several benefits. First, the low offset allows the device to be used \nin applications that must measure current over a wide dynamic range. In this case, the low offset improves the \naccuracy when the sensed currents are on the low end of the measurement range. Another advantage of low \noffset is the ability to sense lower voltage drop across the sense resistor accurately, thus allowing a lower-value \nshunt resistor. Lower-value shunt resistors reduce power loss in the current sense circuit, and help improve the \npower efficiency of the end application.\nThe gain error of the INAx180 -Q1 is specified to be within 1% of the actual value. As the sensed voltage \nbecomes much larger than the offset voltage, this voltage becomes the dominant source of error in the current \nsense measurement.www.ti.comINA180-Q1, INA2180-Q1, INA4180-Q1\nSLYS017D \u2013 APRIL 2018 \u2013 REVISED JULY 2022\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: INA180-Q1  INA2180-Q1  INA4180-Q1\n8.3.4 Rail-to-Rail Output Swing\nThe INAx180 -Q1 allow linear current sensing operation with the output close to the supply rail and GND. The \nmaximum specified output swing to the positive rail is 30 mV, and the maximum specified output swing to \nGND is only 5 mV. To compare the output swing of the INAx180 -Q1 to an equivalent operational amplifier \n(op amp), the inputs are overdriven to approximate the open-loop condition specified in op amp data sheets. \nThe current-sense amplifier is a closed-loop system; therefore, the output swing to GND can be limited by the \nproduct of the offset voltage and amplifier gain.\n", "driven to approximate the open-loop condition specified in op amp data sheets. \nThe current-sense amplifier is a closed-loop system; therefore, the output swing to GND can be limited by the \nproduct of the offset voltage and amplifier gain.\nFor devices that have positive offset voltages, the swing to GND is limited by the larger of either the offset \nvoltage multiplied by the gain or the swing to GND specified in the Electrical Characteristics  table.\nFor example, in an application where the INA180A4 -Q1 (gain = 200 V/V) is used for low-side current sensing \nand the device has an offset of 40 \u00b5V, the product of the device offset and gain results in a value of 8 mV, \ngreater than the specified negative swing value. Therefore, the swing to GND for this example is 8 mV. If the \nsame device has an offset of \u201340 \u00b5V, then the calculated zero differential signal is \u20138 mV. In this case, the offset \nhelps overdrive the swing in the negative direction, and swing performance is consistent with the value specified \nin the Electrical Characteristics  table.\nThe offset voltage is a function of the common-mode voltage as determined by the CMRR specification; \ntherefore, the offset voltage increases when higher common-mode voltages are present. The increase in offset \nvoltage limits how low the output voltage can go during a zero-current condition when operating at higher \ncommon-mode voltages. Figure 8-5  shows the typical limitation of the zero-current output voltage vs common-\nmode voltage for each gain option.\nCommon Mode Voltage (V)Zero Current Output Voltage (V)\n0 246 81012141618 2022 24 2600.0060.0120.0180.0240.030.0360.0420.0480.0540.06\nD033A1\nA2\nA3\nA4\nFigure 8-5.

If this input overload occurs during normal circuit operation, then reduce the value of INA180-Q1, INA2180-Q1, INA4180-Q1\nSLYS017D \u2013 APRIL 2018 \u2013 REVISED JULY 2022 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright \u00a9 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: INA180-Q1  INA2180-Q1  INA4180-Q1\nthe shunt resistor or use a lower-gain version with the chosen sense resistor to avoid this mode of operation. If \na differential overload occurs in a fault event, then the output of the INAx180 -Q1 return to the expected value \napproximately 20 \u00b5s after the fault condition is removed.\nWhen the INAx180 -Q1 output is driven to either the supply rail or ground, increasing the differential input \nvoltage does not damage the device as long as the absolute maximum ratings are not violated. Following these \nguidelines, the INAx180 -Q1 output maintains polarity, and does not suffer from phase reversal.\n8.4.3 Shutdown Mode\nAlthough the INAx180 -Q1 do not have a shutdown pin, the low power consumption of the device allows the \noutput of a logic gate or transistor switch to power the INAx180 -Q1.

This gate or switch turns on and off the \nINAx180 -Q1 power-supply quiescent current.\nHowever, in current shunt monitoring applications, there is also a concern for how much current is drained \nfrom the shunt circuit in shutdown conditions. Evaluating this current drain involves considering the simplified \nschematic of the INAx180 -Q1 in shutdown mode, as shown in Figure 8-6 .\nCBYPASS\n0.1 \u00b5FVS\n2.7 V to 5.5 V\nShutdownRPULL-UP\n10 k\r\nSingle-Channel \nTI DeviceRSENSE\nGNDVSLoad\nIN\u00b1\nIN+OUT\n+\u00b1Bus Voltage\n\u00b10.2 V to +26 V\nRSENSE\nLoad\nOutput\nFigure 8-6. Basic Circuit to Shut Down the INxA180 -Q1 \nThere is typically more than 500 k\u2126 of impedance (from the combination of 500-k\u2126 feedback and\ninput gain set resistors) from each input of the INAx180 -Q1 to the OUT pin and to the GND pin. The amount of \ncurrent flowing through these pins depends on the voltage at the connection.\nRegarding the 500-k \u2126 path to the output pin, the output stage of a disabled INAx180 -Q1 does constitute a \ngood path to ground. Consequently, this current is directly proportional to a shunt common-mode voltage present \nacross a 500-k\u2126 resistor.\nAs a final note, as long as the shunt common-mode voltage is greater than V S when the device is powered up, \nthere is an additional and well-matched 55-\u00b5A typical current that flows in each of the inputs. If less than V S, the \ncommon-mode input currents are negligible, and the only current effects are the result of the 500-k\u2126 resistors.www.ti.comINA180-Q1, INA2180-Q1, INA4180-Q1\nSLYS017D \u2013 APRIL 2018 \u2013 REVISED JULY 2022\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: INA180-Q1  INA2180-Q1  INA4180-Q1\n9 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following", " 2022\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: INA180-Q1  INA2180-Q1  INA4180-Q1\n9 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

However, there are practical limits as to how large the current-sense \nresistor can be in a given application. The INAx180 -Q1 have a typical input bias currents of 80 \u00b5A for each \ninput when operated at a 12-V common-mode voltage input. When large current-sense resistors are used, these \nbias currents cause increased offset error and reduced common-mode rejection. Therefore, using current-sense \nresistors larger than a few ohms is generally not recommended for applications that require current-monitoring \naccuracy. A second common restriction on the value of the current-sense resistor is the maximum allowable \npower dissipation that is budgeted for the resistor. Equation 1  gives the maximum value for the current sense \nresistor for a given power dissipation budget:\nMAX\nSENSE 2\nMAXPDR\nI\u001f\n(1)\nwhere:\n\u2022PDMAX is the maximum allowable power dissipation in R SENSE .\n\u2022IMAX is the maximum current that will flow through R SENSE .\nAn additional limitation on the size of the current-sense resistor and device gain is due to the power-supply \nvoltage, V S, and device swing to rail limitations. In order to make sure that the current-sense signal is properly \npassed to the output, both positive and negative output swing limitations must be examined. Equation 2  provides \nthe maximum values of R SENSE  and GAIN to keep the device from hitting the positive swing limitation.\nMAX SENSE SPI R GAIN Vu u \u001f\n(2)\nwhere:\n\u2022IMAX is the maximum current that will flow through R SENSE .\n\u2022GAIN is the gain of the current sense-amplifier.\n\u2022VSP is the positive output swing as specified in the data sheet.\nTo avoid positive output swing limitations when selecting the value of R SENSE , there", " through R SENSE .\n\u2022GAIN is the gain of the current sense-amplifier.\n\u2022VSP is the positive output swing as specified in the data sheet.\nTo avoid positive output swing limitations when selecting the value of R SENSE , there is always a trade-off \nbetween the value of the sense resistor and the gain of the device under consideration. If the sense resistor \nselected for the maximum power dissipation is too large, then it is possible to select a lower-gain device in order \nto avoid positive swing limitations.\nThe negative swing limitation places a limit on how small of a sense resistor can be used in a given application. \nEquation 3  provides the limit on the minimum size of the sense resistor.\nMIN SENSE SNI R GAIN > Vu u \n(3)\nwhere:\n\u2022IMIN is the minimum current that will flow through R SENSE .\n\u2022GAIN is the gain of the current sense amplifier.\n\u2022VSN is the negative output swing of the device (see Rail-to-Rail Output Swing ).www.ti.comINA180-Q1, INA2180-Q1, INA4180-Q1\nSLYS017D \u2013 APRIL 2018 \u2013 REVISED JULY 2022\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: INA180-Q1  INA2180-Q1  INA4180-Q1\n9.1.3 Signal Filtering\nProvided that the INAx180 -Q1 output is connected to a high impedance input, the best location to filter is at the \ndevice output using a simple RC network from OUT to GND. Filtering at the output attenuates high-frequency \ndisturbances in the common-mode voltage, differential input signal, and INAx180 -Q1 power-supply voltage. If \nfiltering at the output is not possible, or filtering of only the differential input signal is required, it is possible to \napply a filter at the input pins of the device. Figure 9-2  provides an example of how a filter can be used on the \ninput pins of the device.\nVOUTVS\n2.7 V to 5.5 V\nBiasIN\u00b1\nIN+VS\nOUTSingle-Channel \nTI DeviceRF < 10 \r RINT\nCF\nRF < 10 \r RINT+\u00b1Bus Voltage\n\u00b10.2 V to +26 V\nRSENSE", "\u00b1\nIN+VS\nOUTSingle-Channel \nTI DeviceRF < 10 \r RINT\nCF\nRF < 10 \r RINT+\u00b1Bus Voltage\n\u00b10.2 V to +26 V\nRSENSE\nLoad\nGNDf\u00b13dB3dB\nF F F1f2 (R R )C\u0010 S \u000e \nFigure 9-2. Filter at Input Pins\nThe addition of external series resistance creates an additional error in the measurement; therefore, the value \nof these series resistors must be kept to 10 \u03a9 (or less, if possible) to reduce impact to accuracy. The internal \nbias network shown in Figure 9-2  present at the input pins creates a mismatch in input bias currents when a \ndifferential voltage is applied between the input pins. If additional external series filter resistors are added to \nthe circuit, the mismatch in bias currents results in a mismatch of voltage drops across the filter resistors. This \nmismatch creates a differential error voltage that subtracts from the voltage developed across the shunt resistor. \nThis error results in a voltage at the device input pins that is different than the voltage developed across the \nshunt resistor. Without the additional series resistance, the mismatch in input bias currents has little effect on \ndevice operation. The amount of error these external filter resistors add to the measurement can be calculated \nusing Equation 5 , where the gain error factor is calculated using Equation 4 .\nThe amount of variance in the differential voltage present at the device input relative to the voltage developed \nat the shunt resistor is based both on the external series resistance (R F) value as well as internal input resistor \nRINT, as shown in Figure 9-2 . The reduction of the shunt voltage reaching the device input pins appears as a \ngain error when comparing the output voltage relative to the voltage across the shunt resistor. A factor can be \ncalculated to determine the amount of gain error that is introduced by the addition of external series resistance. \nCalculate the expected deviation from the shunt voltage to what is measured at the device input pins is given \nusing Equation 4 :\nINT\nF INT F INT1250 RGain Error Factor(1250 R ) (1250 R ) (R R )u u \u000e u \u000e u\n(4)\nwhere:\n\u2022RINT is the internal input resistor.\n\u2022RF is the", " INT F INT1250 RGain Error Factor(1250 R ) (1250 R ) (R R )u u \u000e u \u000e u\n(4)\nwhere:\n\u2022RINT is the internal input resistor.\n\u2022RF is the external series resistance.INA180-Q1, INA2180-Q1, INA4180-Q1\nSLYS017D \u2013 APRIL 2018 \u2013 REVISED JULY 2022 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright \u00a9 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: INA180-Q1  INA2180-Q1  INA4180-Q1\nWith the adjustment factor from Equation 4 , including the device internal input resistance, this factor varies with \neach gain version, as shown in Table 9-1 .

This is \nthe maximum value for sense resistor R SENSE ; therefore, select R SENSE  to be 0.5 m \u03a9 because it is the closest \nstandard resistor value that meets the power-loss requirement.\nThe next step is to select the appropriate gain and reduce R SENSE , if needed, to keep the output signal swing \nwithin the V S range. Using Equation 2 , and given that I MAX = 40 A and R SENSE  = 0.5 m \u03a9, the maximum \ncurrent-sense gain calculated to avoid the positive swing-to-rail limitations on the output is ", " Using Equation 2 , and given that I MAX = 40 A and R SENSE  = 0.5 m \u03a9, the maximum \ncurrent-sense gain calculated to avoid the positive swing-to-rail limitations on the output is 248.5. To maximize \nthe output signal range, the INA180A4 -Q1 (gain = 200) device is selected for this application.\nTo calculate the accuracy at peak current, the two factors that must be determined are the gain error and the \noffset error. The gain error of the INAx180 -Q1 is specified to be a maximum of 1%. The error due to the offset \nis constant, and is specified to be 125 \u00b5V (maximum) for the conditions where V CM = 0 V and V S = 5 V. Using \nEquation 6 , the percentage error contribution of the offset voltage is calculated to be 0.75%, with total offset error \n= 150 \u00b5V, R SENSE  = 0.5 m\u03a9, and I SENSE  = 40 A.\nSENSE SENSETotal Offset Error (V)Total Offset Error (%) = 100%I R uu\n(6)INA180-Q1, INA2180-Q1, INA4180-Q1\nSLYS017D \u2013 APRIL 2018 \u2013 REVISED JULY 2022 www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright \u00a9 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: INA180-Q1  INA2180-Q1  INA4180-Q1\nOne method of calculating the total error is to add the gain error to the percentage contribution of the offset error. \nHowever, in this case, the gain error and the offset error do not have an influence or correlation to each other. A \nmore statistically accurate method of calculating the total error is to use the RSS sum of the errors, as shown in \nEquation 7 :\n2 2 Total Error (%) = Total Gain Error (%)  + Total Offse t Error (%)\n(7)\nAfter applying Equation 7 , the total current sense error at maximum current is calculated to be 1.25%, and that is \nless than the design example requirement of 1.5%.\nThe INA180A4 -Q1 (gain = 200) also has a bandwidth of 105 kHz that meets the small-signal bandwidth \nrequirement of ", " that is \nless than the design example requirement of 1.5%.\nThe INA180A4 -Q1 (gain = 200) also has a bandwidth of 105 kHz that meets the small-signal bandwidth \nrequirement of 80 kHz.

The device output swing is \nlimited by ground; therefore, the output is biased to this zero output level.

Output Response\n9.3 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe input circuitry of the INAx180 -Q1 accurately measures beyond the power-supply voltage, V S. For example, \nVS can be 5 V, whereas the bus supply voltage at IN+ and IN\u2013 can be as high as 26 V. However, the output \nvoltage range of the OUT pin is limited by the voltages on the VS pin. The INAx180 -Q1 also withstand the full \ndifferential input signal range up to 26 V at the IN+ and IN\u2013 input pins, regardless of whether or not the device \nhas power applied at the VS pin.\n9.3.1 Common-Mode Transients Greater Than 26 V\nWith a small amount of additional circuitry, the INAx180 -Q1 can be used in circuits subject to transients \nhigher than 26 V, such as automotive applications. Use only Zener diodes or Zener-type transient absorbers \n(sometimes referred to as transzorbs )\u2014any other type of transient absorber has an unacceptable time delay. \nStart by adding a pair of resistors as a working impedance for the Zener diode, as shown Figure 9-5 . Keep \nthese resistors as small as possible; most often, around 10 \u2126. Larger values can be used with an effect on \ngain that is discussed in the Signal Filtering  section. This circuit limits only short-term transients; therefore, many \napplications are satisfied with a 10- \u2126", " around 10 \u2126. Larger values can be used with an effect on \ngain that is discussed in the Signal Filtering  section.
