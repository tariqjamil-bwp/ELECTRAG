The devices integrate \neither 4 (DRV8714-Q1) or 8 (DRV8718-Q1) half-\nbridge gate drivers, driver power supplies, current \nshunt amplifiers, and protection monitors reducing \ntotal system complexity, size, and cost.\nA smart", " (DRV8714-Q1) or 8 (DRV8718-Q1) half-\nbridge gate drivers, driver power supplies, current \nshunt amplifiers, and protection monitors reducing \ntotal system complexity, size, and cost.\nA smart gate drive architecture manages dead time to \nprevent shoot-through, controls slew rate to decrease \nelectromagnetic interference (EMI), and optimizes \npropagation delay for enhanced performance.\nInput modes are provided for independent half-\nbridge or H-bridge control. Four PWM inputs can \nbe multiplexed between the different drivers in \ncombination with SPI control.\nWide common mode shunt amplifiers provide inline \ncurrent sensing to continuously measure motor \ncurrent even during recirculating windows. The \namplifier can be used in low-side or high-side sense \nconfigurations if inline sensing is not required.\nThe devices provide an array of protection features \nto promote robust system operation. These include \nunder and overvoltage monitors, V DS overcurrent and \nVGS gate fault monitors for the external MOSFETs, \noffline open load and short circuit diagnostics, and \ninternal thermal warning and shutdown protection.\nDevice Information(1) \nPART NUMBER PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nDRV8714-Q1VQFN (40) 6.00mm x 6.00mm\nHTQFP (48) 7.00mm x 7.00mm\nVQFN (56) 8.00mm x 8.00mm\nDRV8718-Q1 VQFN (56) 8.00mm x 8.00mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\nDRV871x-Q1\n4-Channel\n8-Channel\nMulti-Channel \nSmart Gate DriverVBATControllerPWM\nProtectionInline AmpsCurrent SenseDRVOFF/nFLTSPI\nMOSFET \nHalf-Bridge\nSimple Block DiagramDRV8714-Q1 , DRV8718-Q1\nSLVSEA2D  \u2013 AUGUST 2020 \u2013 REVISED APRIL 2024\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

The devices are tailored for automotive applications by providing \na wide array of configuration and control options, MOSFET slew control, MOSFET propagation delay control, \nand advanced diagnostic and protection functions. The devices provide either 4 (DRV8714-Q1) or 8 (DRV8718-\nQ1) half-bridge gate drivers, each capable of driving high-side and low-side N-channel power MOSFETs. The \nDRV871x-Q1 family of devices reduce total system cost by integrating a high number of gate drivers, driver \npower supples, current shunt amplifiers, and protection monitors.\nThe DRV871x-Q1 family of devices support a wide array of input PWM control modes. These range from \nhalf-bridge control, H-bridge control, and grouped H-bridge control through PWM multiplexing. Recirculation and \nmuxing schemes can be configured through the device SPI interface and input pins. This allows for the device to \nsupport different configurations of the outputs such as individual or grouped multiple motor control schemes.\nThe DRV871x-Q1 devices are based on a smart gate drive architecture (SGD) to reduce system cost and \nimprove reliability. The SGD architecture optimizes dead time to avoid shoot-through conditions, provides \nflexibility in decreasing electromagnetic interference (EMI) with", "1 devices are based on a smart gate drive architecture (SGD) to reduce system cost and \nimprove reliability. The SGD architecture optimizes dead time to avoid shoot-through conditions, provides \nflexibility in decreasing electromagnetic interference (EMI) with MOSFET slew rate control through adjustable \ngate drive current, improves MOSFET propagation delay and matching with an adaptive controller, and protects \nagainst drain to source and gate short circuits conditions with V DS and V GS monitors. A strong pulldown circuit \nhelps prevent dV/dt parasitic gate coupling. The external MOSFET slew control is supported through adjustable \noutput gate drivers. The gate driver peak source and sink current can be configured between 0.5-mA and 62-mA \nwith an additional low current mode to achieve gate drive source and sink currents less than 0.5-mA.\nThe devices can operate with either 3.3-V or 5-V external controllers (MCUs). A dedicated DVDD pins allows for \nexternal power to the device digital core and the digital outputs to be referenced to the controller I/O voltage. It \ncommunicates with the external controller through an SPI bus to manage configuration settings and diagnostic \nfeedback. The device also has an AREF pin which allows for the shunt amplifier reference voltage to be \nconnected to the reference voltage of the external controller ADC. The shunt amplifier outputs are also clamped \nto the AREF pin voltage to protect the inputs of the controller from excessive voltage spikes.\nThe devices provides an array of diagnostic and protection features to monitor system status before operation \nand protect against faults during system operation. These include under and overvoltage monitors for the power \nsupply and charge pump, V DS overcurrent and V GS gate fault monitors for the external MOSFETs, offline open \nload and short circuit detection, windowed watchdog timer for SPI and MCI diagnostics, and internal thermal \nwarning and shutdown protection. The current shunt amplifier can be utilized to monitor load current of the \nsystem. The high common mode range of the amplifier allows for either inline, high-side, or low-side based shunt \nresistor current sensing.\nLastly, the device has a unique power off braking function that gives the ability to enables the low-side drivers \nduring the device's low-power sleep mode in case of detecting a system overvoltage condition. This can be \nutilized to prevent motor back-emf from overcharging the system", " off braking function that gives the ability to enables the low-side drivers \nduring the device's low-power sleep mode in case of detecting a system overvoltage condition. This can be \nutilized to prevent motor back-emf from overcharging the system voltage rail.\nwww.ti.comDRV8714-Q1, DRV8718-Q1\nSLVSEA2D \u2013 AUGUST 2020 \u2013 REVISED APRIL 2024\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: DRV8714-Q1  DRV8718-Q1\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nShunt AmplifierGate DriverVDRAIN\nVDS\nVGSVCP\nHS\nVCP\nLSVGS VDS\nDigital Core\nControl\nInputs DiagnosticGHx\nSHx\nGLx\nPGNDxDRAIN\n16-Bit\nSPISDI\nSDOSCLKnSCSPower SuppliesPVDD\nVCPCP1H\nCP1L\nDriver\nControl\nWatchdogVDVDD\nSPx\nSNx+\n-\nRef/k\nVAREFVAREFVAREF\nDRVOFF/nFLTSOx\nAGNDTripler \nCharge \nPump\nDVDD\nDGNDVCP\nBRAKE\nnSLEEP\nIN1\nIN2\nIN3\nIN4AREFBlankGNDCP2H\nCP2L\nVDVDD\nPWM \nMapping\nProtection\nAmplifier \nConfig.Device \nFaultDrivers \nDisable\nFigure 7-1.

The two interface modes share the same four pins, allowing the \ndifferent versions to be pin to pin compatible. This allows for application designers to evaluate with one interface \nversion and potentially switch to another with minimal modifications to their design. The DRV8718-Q1 device is \nonly available with the SPI interface.\n7.3.2.1 Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)\nThe DRV8718-Q1 and DRV8714S-Q1 SPI device variants support a serial communication bus that allows for \nan external controller to send and receive serial data with the driver.

This allows for the external controller to \nconfigure device settings and read detailed fault information. The interface is a four wire serial interface utilizing \nthe SCLK, SDI, SDO, and nSCS pins.\n\u2022The nSCS pin is the chip select input. A logic low signal on this pin enables SPI communication.\n\u2022The SCLK pin is an input which accepts a clock signal to determine when data is captured and propagated \non SDI and SDO.\n\u2022The SDI pin is the data input\n\u2022The SDO pin is the data output. The SDO pin uses a push-pull output structure referenced to the DVDD \ninput.\nFor more information on the SPI, see the SPI Interface  section\n7.3.2.2 Hardware (H/W)\nThe DRV8714H-Q1 hardware interface device variant converts the four SPI pins into four resistor configurable \ninputs, GAIN, VDS, IDRIVE, and MODE. This allows for the application designer to configure the most \ncommonly used device settings by tying the pin logic high or logic low, or with a simple pullup or pulldown \nresistor. This removes the requirement for an SPI bus from the external controller. General fault information can \nstill be obtained through the nFAULT pin.\nThe hardware interface settings are latched on power up of the device. They can reconfigured by putting the \ndevice in sleep mode with the nSLEEP pin, changing the setting, and reenabling the device through nSLEEP.\n\u2022The GAIN pin configures the current shunt amplifier gainDRV8714-Q1, DRV8718-Q1\nSLVSEA2D \u2013 AUGUST 2020 \u2013 REVISED APRIL 2024\n www.ti.com\n30 Submit Document Feedback Copyright \u00a9 2024 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DRV8714-Q1  DRV8718-Q1\n\u2022The VDS pin configures the voltage threshold of the V DS overcurrent monitors.\n\u2022The IDRIVE pin configures the gate drive current strength.\n\u2022The MODE pin configures the PWM input control mode.\nFor more information on the hardware interface, see the Pin Diagrams  section.\n7.3.3 Input PWM Control Modes\nThe DRV8718", " configures the gate drive current strength.\n\u2022The MODE pin configures the PWM input control mode.\nFor more information on the hardware interface, see the Pin Diagrams  section.\n7.3.3 Input PWM Control Modes\nThe DRV8718-Q1 and DRV8714-Q1 support a highly configurable Half-Bridge Control Scheme  in order to be \nadapted for a wide variety of output load configurations and control regulations. This control scheme helps to \nreduce the number of required PWM channels and pins from the external controller. 4 independent PWM control \ninputs can be provided to the INx input pins and assigned to any of the output half-bridge drivers. The device \ninternally handles the dead-time generation between high-side and low-side switching so that a single PWM \ninput can be used to control a half-bridge.\nAdditionally the DRV8714-Q1 supports several other standard control schemes for either H-bridge or solenoid \ncontrol.

Gate Driver Functional Block Diagram\n7.3.4.2 Slew Rate Control (IDRIVE)\nThe IDRIVE component of the smart gate drive architecture implements adjustable gate drive current control to \nadjust the external MOSFET V DS slew rate. This is achieved by implementing adjustable pull up (I DRVP) and pull \ndown (I DRVN ) current sources for the internal gate driver architecture.\nThe external MOSFET V DS slew rates are a critical factor for optimizing radiated and conducted emissions, \ndiode reverse recovery, dV/dt parasitic gate coupling, and overvoltage or undervoltage transients on the switch-\nnode of the half-bridge. IDRIVE operates on the principle that the V DS slew rates are predominantly determined \nby the rate of the gate charge (or gate current) delivered during the MOSFET Q GD or Miller charging region. By \nallowing the gate driver to adjust the gate current, it can effectively control the slew rate of the external power \nMOSFETs.\nIDRIVE allows the DRV871x-Q1 to dynamically change the gate driver current setting through the IDRVP_x and \nIDRVN_x SPI registers or IDRIVE pin on H/W interface devices.

Dead time is the period \nof body diode conduction time between the switching of the external high-side and low-side MOSFET to prevent \nany cross conduction or shoot through. The DRV871x-Q1 uses V GS monitors to implement a break and then \nmake dead time scheme by measuring the external MOSFET V GS voltage to determine when to properly enable \nthe external MOSFETs. This scheme allows the gate driver to adjust the dead time for variations in the system \nsuch as temperature drift, aging, voltage fluctuations, and variation in the external MOSFET parameters. An \nadditional fixed digital dead time (t DEAD_D ) can be inserted if desired and is adjustable through the SPI registers.\nThe second component focuses on preventing parasitic dV/dt gate charge coupling. This is implemented \nby enabling a strong gate current pulldown (I STRONG ) whenever the opposite MOSFET in the half-bridge is \nswitching. This feature helps remove parasitic charge that couples into the external MOSFET gate when the \nhalf-bridge switch node is rapidly slewing.\nThe third component implements a gate fault detection scheme to detect an issue with the gate voltage. This \nis used to detect pin-to-pin solder defects, a MOSFET gate failure, or a gate stuck high or stuck low voltage \ncondition. This is done by using the V GS monitors to measure the gate voltage after the end of the t DRIVE  time. \nIf the gate voltage has not reached the proper threshold, the gate driver will report the corresponding fault \ncondition. To ensure a false fault is not detected, a t DRIVE  time should be selected that is longer than the time \nrequired to charge or discharge the MOSFET gate. The t DRIVE  time does not impact the PWM minimum duration \nand will terminate early if another PWM command is received.DRV8714-Q", " time should be selected that is longer than the time \nrequired to charge or discharge the MOSFET gate.

The PDR control function is only available in the Half-Bridge \nControl  PWM mode and on SPI device variants.\nThe propagation delay reduction (PDR) primary goal is to reduce the turn on and turn off delay of the external \nMOSFET by using dynamic pre-charge and pre-discharge currents before the MOSFET Q GD miller region. \nThis can enable the driver to achieve higher and lower duty cycle resolution while still meeting difficult EMI \nrequirements.\nThe post-charge acceleration function allows for the MOSFET to more quickly reach its low resistive or off state \nto minimize power losses by increasing the post-charge and post-discharge gate current after the MOSFET Q GD \nmiller region.\nAn example of the MOSFET pre-charge and post-charge current profiles are shown in Figure 7-13 .

This is done by measuring \nthe half-bridge V SHx voltage during the dead-time period to determine if the high-side or low-side body diode \nis conducting. If the current polarity cannot be determined it is assumed that the configured MOSFET through \nPWMx_HL is the drive MOSFET. The automatic freewheel detection can be disabled with the IDIR_MAN_x \ncontrol register. In the manual freewheel modes, the PDR loop relies on the PWMx_HL control register to \ndetermine which MOSFET is the drive MOSFET and which MOSFET is the freewheel MOSFET. IF PWMx_HL \n= 0b, the high-side MOSFET is the drive MOSFET and the low-side MOSFET is the freewheel MOSFET. If \nPWMx_HL = 1b, the low-side MOSFET is the drive MOSFET and high-side MOSFET is the freewheel MOSFET.\nwww.ti.comDRV8714-Q1, DRV8718-Q1\nSLVSEA2D \u2013 AUGUST 2020 \u2013 REVISED APRIL 2024\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 43\nProduct Folder Links: DRV8714-Q1  DRV8718-Q1\nFigure 7-15  shows the high-side MOSFET (HS1) controlling the V SHx switch-node voltage transition and the \nlow-side MOSFET (LS1) acting as the freewheeling MOSFET.\nVBAT\nMHS1: PWM \nDrive FET\nLS1: PWM \nFW FETLS2: ON", " voltage transition and the \nlow-side MOSFET (LS1) acting as the freewheeling MOSFET.\nVBAT\nMHS1: PWM \nDrive FET\nLS1: PWM \nFW FETLS2: ONHS2: OFF\nDrive Current Path\nFW Current PathHS Drive PWM Turn \nOn / Off Example\nVGSHxVINx\nIGHxIDRVPIHOLD\nVGSLx\nIGLxISTRONG\nIHOLDtPD\nIDRVN\ntDEADtPDVSHx\nISTRONGIPRE_CHR IPST_CHR\nVSHx_LVSHx_HIPRE_DCHR\nVSHx_LVSHx_HIPST_DCHRISTRONG\nICHR_FW\nIHOLDtDONtPRE_CHR\ntPST_CHR\nIDCHR_FWtPRE_DCHRtPST_DCHR\ntDOFF\ntDEADDrive PWM\nFreewheel PWM\nFigure 7-15.

The difference in turn on and turn off delay is introduced by a dependancy on whether \nthe freewheeling MOSFET must be charged or discharged before the V SHx slew can occur. If the freewheeling \nMOSFET charges or discharges before the drive MOSFET this can introduce a mismatch causing duty cycle \ndistortion. The DCC control loop adds an additional delay to match both the turn on and turn off delays.

The charge pump allows the high-side and low-side \ngate drivers to properly bias the external N-channel MOSFETs with respect to its source voltage across a wide \ninput supply voltage range. The charge pump output is regulated (V VCP) to maintain a fixed voltage respect to \nVPVDD. The charge pump is continuously monitored for an undervoltage (V CP_UV ) event to prevent under driven \nMOSFET conditions or in case of a short circuit condition.\nThe charge pump provides several configuration options. By default the charge pump will automatically switch \nbetween tripler (dual-stage) mode and doubler (single-stage) mode after the PVDD pin voltage crosses the \nVCP_SO  threshold in order to reduce power dissipation. On SPI device variants, the charge pump can also be \nconfigured to always remain in tripler or doubler mode through the SPI register setting CP_MODE.\nThe charge pumps requires a low ESR, 1-\u00b5F, 16-V ceramic capacitor (X5R or X7R recommended) between \nthe PVDD and VCP pins to act as the storage capacitor.

Current measurements are \ncommonly used to implement overcurrent protection, external torque control, or commutation with an external \ncontroller. Due to the high common-mode range of the shunt amplifier it can support low-side, high-side, or inline \nshunt configurations. The current shunt amplifiers include features such as programmable gain, unidirectional \nand bidirectional support, output blanking, and a dedicated voltage reference pin (AREF) to set a mid point bias \nvoltage for the amplifier output. A simplified block diagram is shown in Figure 7-17 . SPx should connect to the \npositive terminal of the shunt resistor and SNx should connect to the negative terminal of the shunt resistor. If the \namplifiers are not utilized, the AREF, SNx, SPx inputs can be tied to AGND, AGND to PCB GND and the SOx \noutputs left floating.DRV8714-Q1, DRV8718-Q1\nSLVSEA2D \u2013 AUGUST 2020 \u2013 REVISED APRIL 2024\n www.ti.com\n46 Submit Document Feedback Copyright \u00a9 2024 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DRV8714-Q1  DRV8718-Q1\nNote\nIt should be noted that in high-side sense configuration there exists a leakage path of approximately \n600k\u03a9 to GND when nSLEEP = 0V.\nSPx\nSNx+-\nSOx\nRSHUNT IL+\n-RIN\nRIN\nRGAINRGAINRREF1\nRREF2AREF\nAGND\nBlank\nS&H\nFigure 7-17.

When DRVOFF/nFLT or EN_DRV are asserted, all half-bridges will be set \nHi-Z by enabling the gate driver pull downs regardless of the other pin or SPI inputs.DRV8714-Q1, DRV8718-Q1\nSLVSEA2D \u2013 AUGUST 2020 \u2013 REVISED APRIL 2024\n www.ti.com\n50 Submit Document Feedback Copyright \u00a9 2024 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DRV8714-Q1  DRV8718-Q1\nThe EN_DRV SPI register bit is provided for a controlled power up sequence. After device power up all the \nhalf-bridges remain disabled (all pulldowns active, EN_DRV = 0b) until the EN_DRV register bit is asserted \nhigh. This allows for the system to power up and conduct configuration sequences before the gate drivers are \nenabled. On H/W devices, this functionality is not provided and the driver will automatically enable after power \nup.\nThe DRVOFF/nFLT pin provides a direct hardware pin to shutdown the output drivers without relying on an SPI \ncommand or PWM input change.\nThe DRVOFF/nFLT pin is a multi-function configurable pin. By default, the pin functions as a global driver \ndisable. If this function is not required, the pin be changed to an open-drain fault interrupt for the MCU through \nthe device DRVOFF_nFLT register setting. When configured as DRVOFF, a logic high input will disable the \ndrivers and logic low will allow for normal operation.\n7.3.8.2 Low I", " interrupt for the MCU through \nthe device DRVOFF_nFLT register setting. When configured as DRVOFF, a logic high input will disable the \ndrivers and logic low will allow for normal operation.\n7.3.8.2 Low I Q Powered Off Braking (POB, BRAKE)\nThe DRV871x-Q1 provide the ability to enable the low-side gate drivers while the device is in its low-power sleep \nmode (nSLEEP = logic low). This allows the external low-side power MOSFETs to be enabled while maintaining \na low quiescent current draw from the power supply. Enabling the external low-side MOSFETs allows the device \nto actively brake a motor connected to the external half-bridges by shorting the back emf across the motor \nterminals. This can help prevent reverse driving of the motor by an external force from overcharging the system \npower supply by dissipating the energy in the low-side MOSFETs. This function is only available while the device \nis in its low-power sleep mode. The function is enabled by taking the BRAKE pin to logic high.\nThe powered off braking function is available on half-bridges 5, 6, 7, and 8 on the DRV8718-Q1 device. On the \nDRV8714-Q1, the power off braking function is available on all four half-bridges. The BRAKE pin will enable \nor disable the low-side gate drivers for all four of the half-bridges together. The powered off braking function \nrequires the PVDD voltage supply to be present in order to enable the low-side gate drivers, but the function can \noperate without the DVDD logic power supply present.\nIn case of a short circuit to power supply fault present on the power stage, a simple overcurrent detector circuit \nwith analog RC deglitch filter is provided to disable the low-side MOSFET if a high current event is detected \nwhile braking. This is needed since the normal overcurrent protection circuits are disabled during the device \nlow-power sleep mode. The overcurrent comparator and RC deglitch filter values are fixed and cannot be \nadjusted.\nThe powered off braking function is enabled through the BRAKE pin and the BRAKE pin can be pulled high \nthrough several different methods. To reduce quiescent current draw, the pulldown resistance of the BRAKE pin \nis reduced to 1MOhm while", " function is enabled through the BRAKE pin and the BRAKE pin can be pulled high \nthrough several different methods. To reduce quiescent current draw, the pulldown resistance of the BRAKE pin \nis reduced to 1MOhm while in device low-power sleep mode. The BRAKE pin can be always left high while the \ndevice is in low-power sleep mode or can be set high in response to a rising voltage on the power supply. The \nBRAKE pin has an internal voltage clamp allowing it to be connected directly to the PVDD battery supply through \na Zener diode (to set overvoltage threshold) with a series resistor to limit the current. The powered off function \ncan be set to automatically enable in low-power sleep mode by leaving the BRAKE pin disconnected and relying \non the internal overvoltage monitor.\nSome methods to pull up the BRAKE pin and enable the powered off braking function include:\n\u2022Option 1: Internal overvoltage monitor. BRAKE pin should be left not-connected (Hi-Z)\n\u2022Option 2: Voltage triggered pull up with passive Zener diode. An external Zener diode can be added to the \nBRAKE pin to create an overvoltage trigger that is lower than the internal overvoltage monitor.\n\u2022Option 3: MCU fixed digital output high or MCU digital output in response to motor movement detected by \nsenor or rising voltage. A digital output to the BRAKE pin can directly control whether the power off braking \nfunction is enabled (LO = disabled, HI = enabled).\n\u2022Option 4: The power off braking function can be disabled by shorting/connecting the BRAKE pin directly to \nPCB ground.\nBy default (BRAKE pin not connected), the powered off braking function is enabled by an internal overvoltage \nmonitor that will detect the PVDD voltage and enable the low-side braking if voltage crosses the comparator \nwww.ti.comDRV8714-Q1, DRV8718-Q1\nSLVSEA2D \u2013 AUGUST 2020 \u2013 REVISED APRIL 2024\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 51\nProduct Folder Links: DRV8714-Q1  DRV8718-Q1\nthreshold.

This is accomplished by an integrated pull up and pull down current source \non the SHx pin which connect to the external half-bridge switch-node. The offline diagnostics are controlled by \nthe associated registers bits in the OLSC_CTRL register. First, the offline diagnostic mode needs to be enabled \nthrough the EN_OLSC register setting. Then the individual current sources can be enabled through the PD_SHx \nand PU_SHx register settings.\nThe voltage on the SHx pin will be continuously monitored through the internal V DS comparators. During the \ndiagnostic state the V DS comparators will report the real-time voltage feedback on the SHx pin node in the SPI \nregisters in the associated VDS register status bit. When in the V DS comparators are in diagnostic mode, the \nglobal DS_GS SPI register bits will not report faults or warnings.\nBefore enabling the offline diagnostics", "x pin node in the SPI \nregisters in the associated VDS register status bit. When in the V DS comparators are in diagnostic mode, the \nglobal DS_GS SPI register bits will not report faults or warnings.\nBefore enabling the offline diagnostics it is recommended to place the external MOSFET half-bridges in the \ndisabled state through the EN_DRV register setting. Additionally, the V DS comparator threshold (VDS_LVL) \nshould be adjusted to 1-V or greater to ensure enough headroom for the internal blocking diode forward voltage \ndrop.\nOn H/W device variants, this feature is not available.\nDRV\nSHxDRAIN\nVDS\nVDS\nPGND/SLxDRV8\nSHyDRAIN\nVDS\nVDS\nPGND/SLyGHx\nGLxPU_SHx PU_SHy\nPD_SHy PD_SHxGHy\nGLyBDC\nFigure 7-29.

This can be confirmed with a simple calculation as shown in \nEquation 1 . Since the charge pump supplies", " pump load capability is sufficient for the type of external MOSFET, number \nof PWM half-bridges, and desired PWM frequency. This can be confirmed with a simple calculation as shown in \nEquation 1 . Since the charge pump supplies both the high-side and low-side gate drivers, the number of both \nswitching high-side and low-side MOSFETs should be taken into consideration. This will depend on both the \nnumber of PWM half-bridges and the freewheeling mode (if the opposite MOSFET is being switched).\nIVCP (A) = Q G (C) x f PWM (Hz) x # of switching FETs (1)\nUsing the input design parameters as an example, we can show that in this scenario that output load capability \nof the charge pump is sufficient in Equation 2 . For this example, four active half-bridges were assumed with \nactive freewheeling totaling 8 switching MOSFETs.\nIVCP = 30 nC x 20 kHz x 8 = 4.8 mA (2)\n9.2.2.1.2 IDRIVE  Calculation Example\nThe gate drive current strength, I DRIVE , is selected based on the gate-to-drain charge of the external MOSFETs \nand the target rise and fall times at the switch-node. If I DRIVE  is selected to be too low for a given MOSFET, \nthen the MOSFET may not turn on or off completely within the configured t DRIVE  time and a gate fault may be \nasserted.

Place this capacitor as close to the PVDD pin as possible with a thick trace or ground plane connected to \nthe GND pin. Additionally, bypass the PVDD pin using a bulk capacitor rated for PVDD. This component can be \nelectrolytic. This capacitance must be at least 10 \u00b5F. It is acceptable if this capacitance is shared with the bulk \ncapacitance for the external power MOSFETs.\nAdditional bulk capacitance is required to bypass the high current path on the external MOSFETs. This bulk \ncapacitance should be placed such that it minimizes the length of any high current paths through the external \nMOSFETs. The connecting metal traces should be as wide as possible, with numerous vias connecting PCB \nlayers. These practices minimize inductance and allow the bulk capacitor to deliver high current.\nPlace a low-ESR ceramic capacitor between the CPL", "ETs. The connecting metal traces should be as wide as possible, with numerous vias connecting PCB \nlayers. These practices minimize inductance and allow the bulk capacitor to deliver high current.\nPlace a low-ESR ceramic capacitor between the CPL1 / CPH1 and CPL2 / CP2H pins. The CP1 capacitor \nshould be 0.1 \u00b5F, rated for PVDD, and be of type X5R or X7R. The CP2 capacitor should be 0.1 \u00b5F, rated for \nPVDD + 16 V, and be of type X5R or X7R. Additionally, place a low-ESR ceramic capacitor between the VCP \nand PVDD pins. This capacitor should be 1 \u00b5F, rated for 16 V, and be of type X5R or X7R.\nBypass the DVDD pin to the DGND pin with a 1.0 \u00b5F low-ESR ceramic capacitor rated for 6.3 V and of type \nX5R or X7R. Place this capacitor as close to the pin as possible and minimize the path from the capacitor to the \nDGND pin. Bypass the AREF pin to the AGND pin with a 0.1 \u00b5F low-ESR ceramic capacitor rated for 6.3 V and \nof type X5R or X7R. Place this capacitor as close to the pin as possible and minimize the path from the capacitor \nto the AGND pin. If local bypass capacitors are already present on these power supplies in close proximity of the \ndevice to minimize noise, these additional components for DVDD and/or AREF are not required.\nThe DRAIN pin can be shorted directly to the PVDD pin.
